This is [my](https://github.com/cheezgi) layout. I have some pretty neat stuff
in it.

* Parentheses, brackets, braces on left index and middle fingers
* Two tri-layers with possibility of three (!!!)
* Single key to swap layouts between colemak and qwerty
* Mouse movement in T layout, with scrolling
* Vim-style arrow keys
* Tap for enter, hold for shift

That's about it. There's still some wasted space in the bottom layers
but I can easily fix that. (by adding more tri-layers because why not)
