This is my keyboard layout for the OLKB Planck keyboard.

* Parentheses, brackets, braces on index, middle, and ring fingers
* Single key to swap layouts between colemak and qwerty
* Mouse movement in T layout, with scrolling
* Vim-style arrow keys

There are two unused keys on the base layer. Feel free to put whatever you want
there.

In order to install this layout, clone this repo and place it in the `keymaps`
directory, then run `make rev4-zh-<programmer>` from the `planck` directory.
